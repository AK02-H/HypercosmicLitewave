Milestone 4 v1.0 2/1/23
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

-Created the world model system with entities
-Added collision

Code Additions
--------------

-An abstract entity class and a player + bullet class that derive from it
-A world class that stores all entities, updating them every frame
-A collision component that entities can have to check collisions against each other

Tests
-----
Currently only a rectangle collider is being used, but it is very efficient whent there are lots of entities on screen
When players are only checking collisions against bullets, the game can run efficiently at around 60 fps
However when all entities are checking collisions against all other entities, the game slows to around 10-12 frames in debug mode

Notes
-----
I want to add a circle collider in the future but this might be complex to check against rectangles, and could cause more slowdown
When a sprite is rotated a collider might have to rotate too, but adding rotation calculations to the rect colliders could
be expensive
