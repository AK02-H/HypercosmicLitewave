--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

Able to efficiently clear the screen to a colour; 3d stars movement

Code Additions
--------------

Clear screen function: uses an efficient incremental algorithm to fill the screen memory in segments. Writes directly to the memory for the first segment, then keeps doubling
that block of memory with memcopy to perfectly fill the screen memory.
Projection function for the stars, makes the stars more transparent as they come towards the screen

Tests
-----

When rendering 500,000 stars, the frame rate is consistently at 75 fps in release mode, but 23fps in debug mode
When rendering 50,00 stars in debug mode, the frame rate is consistently 200 fps.
Tried making it so the other rgb values change the closer it gets to the screen, but this resulted in strange colouring issues where the overlapping stars furthest away from the screen would 
would be unexpercted colours

Notes
-----
Screen clear only works when screen height is a power of 2, needs extra functionality to work on odd screen heights.
Possible to make the star's z coordinate affect the size, making it bigger the closer it gets to the screen giving it more depth
