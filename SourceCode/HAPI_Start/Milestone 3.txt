--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

-Black box graphics system
-Can clip sprites to the screen for saving memory
-Can move the player with the xbox controller
-Sprites can be rotated

Code Additions
--------------

-A rectangle class that is used for clipping a sprite to the screen so it only draws the visible parts of the sprite, but can also be used for more various
features later in the engine such as collision boxes and UI buttons.
-New Visualisation and Sprite classes that handle the loading and drawing of sprites separate from everything else. Visualisation derives from an IGraphics
interface that allows for interchanging the graphics renderer without affecting the rest of the engine. The visualisation class indexes sprites so the texture only
needs to be loaded once but can be drawn in multiple places at once
-The input code also checks for xbox controller input as well as keyboard input to modify the player coordinate values
-Sprites have the option to be rotated, though this makes the render function slower

Tests
-----

Pixels that are not within the screen rectangle are skipped over in the render function to save memory.
Before pixels are drawn the sprite rectangle is checked whether any of it overlaps with the screen. If it doesn't, the render function isn't called at all.
When rendering sprites off screen with rect clipping, the program runs faster than when it was using the original blitting because it doesn't need to check every pixel,
only pixels in a range.
Rendering many sprites with rect clipping is slightly slower than with the regular blit functions, but still functionable.
Rendering sprites with rotation is fairly slow compared to regular blitting because of the rotation calculations taking long.

Notes
-----

When a sprite is rotated there are sometimes issues with the rectangle, as it may not be the right size and won't draw the sprite properly because of the clipping.
Either the sprite rect needs to be expanded permanently if it wants to be rotated, or rotatable sprites can't be clipped with rects
